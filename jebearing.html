        <div id="stepone">
          <div>
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p id="problem">JE Bearing is a Southwestern Ontario company that builds, fixes, and improves a wide variety
              of
              machined parts, which are used to make their client's existing workflow more cost effective, time
              efficient,
              and
              sustainable. The company has complex, multi-step manufacturing workflows that need to be managed and
              maintained.
              Their paper-based communication and data organization system is inefficient and out of date, making it
              hard
              for
              employees to access information and communicate with one another without work disruptions.</p>

            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p id="solution">The company approached the Reactr Team at Fanshawe College to design, build and implement a
              Web-based Online Industrial Training Application for worker training, data reference, and communication,
              that
              will mitigate a number of issues that are specific to JE Bearing's workplace environment.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p id="outcome">The application, already in Phase Two, is accessible on a tablet at each work station where
              workers can log in, search for the jobs they need to complete, and follow the instructions. The
              information can be easily updated by an administrator or supervisor at anytime so that instructions stay
              accurate and up to date. Implementing this application into their daily work-flow will show measurable
              increases
              in productivity and communication. The integration of different information sources into one application
              will
              result in workers getting all required news and job information in a time fashion. Adding and customising
              content in the application will be manageable by anyone with a registered account, making it easier to
              keep
              information current, timely and accurate.</p>

            <p>An Intuitive content management system that administrators can access to add, edit, delete, and organize
              instructions, images, tools, materials, and fixtures. It also involves a front-end user interface where
              workers can easily view the instructions, and any specific information about a mechanical part.</p>

      <h1>TOOLS</h1>

      <p>The application was developed using Laravel, a PHP framework, which provides easy ways to implement common
        tasks such as: authentication, routing, and Blade view templating. Dev tools like CSS Grid and Flexbox were
        used, taking advantage of their flexibility being available natively in the browser, without adding size to the
        application. Javascript was used extensively to provide a more performant user interface and fast asynchronous
        content loading. The project was a great implementation of the MVC structure.</p>
