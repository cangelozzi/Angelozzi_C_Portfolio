        <h1>ABOUT</h1>

        <div id="ds_stepone">
          <div>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p id="ds_problem">Dental Strategy is a business management consulting firm
              specializing in dental practices, from startup, to Human Resources,
              patient retention and other areas related to overall practice
              management. They approached the Reactr team to collaborate in
              creating a learning management system (LMS) that will further assist
              dental practices in providing sound professional and consistent
              administrative and human resource training for their employees.
              By converting the existing “wiki” format of educational materials to a
              modular online learning tool, Dental Strategy seeks to change the way
              their clients train and educate their employees. Through an
              approachable lesson structure and a consistent user experience,
              practice employees will be able to gain the required knowledge for
              their role. Gamification concepts will be employed to provide
              consistent and useful performance feedback to users.</p>

            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
            <p id="ds_solution">Offering a modular online tool which has been surging in popularity in dedicated
              learning spaces for making education clear and engaging, and allowing
              for content to be easier to update and expand. Such LMS software
              has not yet been consistently leveraged in the dental industry. Dental
              Strategy seeks to migrate their previous “wiki” to a modern learning
              management system, so that dental practices can more quickly and
              efficiently onboard and train new employees in every role.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p id="ds_outcome">The ability to easily customize the material to use different media as
              needed will allow the application to be appealing to the majority of
              practices, therefore hopefully maximizing the marketability of the
              application. Furthermore, the user management system and
              progression tracking will appeal to practice administrators, as a
              means to save time (and money) spent on content sourcing and
              creation, progress tracking and other resource-intensive activities.
              Most importantly, employees will be better able to easily access
              training in a linear or non-linear way, be able to track their progress at
              various levels, and ultimately be more engaged and satisfied with the
              workplace training experience.</p>

              maintenance of content and performance tracking. An overall ‘knowledge structure’ allows employees to

      <h1>TOOLS</h1>

      <p>By working from the structure of the information in the existing
        Dental Strategy resources, a responsive application interface with the
        use of HTML, CSS and SASS was designed. The layout was thought
        strictly from the needs of the user on a given page, allowing the users
        to always have the necessary resources, while not cluttering with
        excessive information. With a thorough and extensible back end architecture using MySQL
        and Laravel, a strong API was created, allowing the data to be
        extended for future applications or tools the client may wish to
        develop. Furthermore, the API reduces difficulties communicating
        through various portions of the application during development.</p>
